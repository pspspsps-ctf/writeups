# bathroom-break

> I was on an in-state skiing trip with my family when we decided to go out and see some sights. I remember needing to go to the bathroom near where these pictures were taken and then leaving a review. Can you find this review for me?

Almost got first blood!!! 🐈

We are given with two images of the place that we should look for.
