We are given with the challenge file: `secret.tar.gz`

It only contains one file, which is `a.txt`

For some reason, my instinct kicked in to look at my keyboard.

Following the trail of EDCVGT and VFRGYHN, it formed U and M! Come to think of it, those are weirdly placed letters as well and it does make sense.

Grabbed an image of a keyboard and drew there instead.

Whew! (the end brace tho haha, can't draw it correctly)
