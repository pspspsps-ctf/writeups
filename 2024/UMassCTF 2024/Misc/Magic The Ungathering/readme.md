# Magic The Ungathering

> I took 2 much red40 while watchmaxxing spongebob and I forgor to write a welcome challenge. Now all I can see is this image burned into my retinas. WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?! (There is a word in this image, wrap it in UMASS{} to get the flag. Example: if the word was ALLIGATOR the flag would be UMASS{ALLIGATOR})

Solution:

We are provided with one image file: `image.jpg`

I tried to squint my eye but no luck. Decided to use https://images.google.com/ and see if there are any similar images out there.

Ohh, Stereogram! 

Searched for a solver and ended at https://piellardj.github.io/stereogram-solver/
> An autostereogram (also known as Magic Eye) is a 2D image designed to create the illusion of 3D. In each image, there is a 3D object that can only be viewed by looking at the image a certain way, as if the screen was transparent and you looked at the wall behind it.

Heh, there's the "Magic Eye", so the "Magic" and "retinas" were hints after all.
