Solution:

I was just checking the source file via dev tools and suddenly the blue ball sped up o_o

Though when I tried to put a bit more effort...I have overridden the JS file, set the x of the `ballPos` to `100`, refresh, and just waited. It sped up again even though it's supposed to have a fixed posiiton on the server side o_o
