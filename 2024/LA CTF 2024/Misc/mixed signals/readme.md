Solution:

We were given with a `message.wav` file and, woops, it seems the author messed something, so yeah we can indeed hear the flag.

Had to use https://www.worldometers.info/languages/nato-phonetic-alphabet/ as a reference since phonetic alphabet was used to describe the flag

Flag: `lactf{c4n_y0u_plz_unm1x_my_s1gn4lz}`
